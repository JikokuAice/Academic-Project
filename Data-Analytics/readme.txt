# CC5067NT - Smart Data Discovery

## Project Description

This project focuses on analyzing a dataset of employee salaries in the tech industry from 2020 to 2023. The primary objective is to gain insights into the factors that influence salaries, such as experience level, employment type, job title, remote work ratio, and company size. The analysis involves several key steps, including data preparation, statistical analysis, and data visualization.

## Objectives

1. **Data Understanding**:
   - Understand the structure and content of the dataset.
   - Identify and describe each column in the dataset.

2. **Data Preparation**:
   - Load the data into a pandas DataFrame.
   - Clean the data by removing unnecessary columns, checking for duplicates, and handling missing values.
   - Rename columns and transform data as needed.

3. **Data Analysis**:
   - Perform statistical analysis to compute summary statistics such as mean, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis.
   - Calculate correlations between different variables.

4. **Data Exploration**:
   - Identify and visualize the top 15 job titles based on frequency.
   - Determine which job titles have the highest salaries and illustrate this with a bar graph.
   - Analyze salaries based on experience levels and visualize the findings.
   - Create histograms and box plots to explore the distribution of salaries based on company size.

## Key Insights

- **Factors Affecting Salaries**: The dataset provides valuable insights into how various factors such as job title, experience level, and company size influence employee salaries in the tech industry.
- **Visualization**: The project employs various visualization techniques, including bar graphs, histograms, and box plots, to illustrate the distribution and relationship of salaries with other variables.

## Tools and Technologies
